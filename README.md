**W A R N I N G**: This is a previous proof of concept of CanAirIO device firmware over a TTGO T-Display board, but now it is only a old reference. The last stable version of [CanAirIO device](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware) already have support for this board and many features more. Please use the official [CanAirIO Firmware](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware/releases) instead of this firmware.

# CanAirIO

Citizen science project with mobile and fixed sensors for measuring air quality (PM 2.5) using low-cost sensors and smartphones. Built with a `ESP32` module board and some dust sensor, like Sensirion, Panasonic, Honeywell and Samsung interfaced with an [CanAirIO Android app](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_android#canairio-air-quality-reporter).

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hpsaturn.pollutionreporter" target="_blank"><img  width="120" src="screenshots/gplayicon.png"></a>

This repo is a TTGO T-Display version of CanAirIO that supports two Air Quality sensors: 

- [x] Panasonic PM Sensor 
- [x] Bosch BME680 VOC sensor for IAQ.

<img align="right" width="290" src="screenshots/collage00.jpg">


## Features

- [X] PM 1.0, 2.5 and PM 10 values.
- [X] Pressure, altitude, Humidity, Temperature.
- [X] Gas resistence (IAQ parameter)
- [X] Tag geo localization (mobile mode)
- [X] Save mobile trips on SD (mobile mode)
- [X] Share mobile tracks (mobile mode)
- [X] Set wifi parameters via Bluetooth (fixed mode)
- [X] Set geo localization via Bluetooth (fixed mode)
- [X] InfluxDB publication (fixed mode)
- [X] OTA updates via local WiFi
- [X] Enable/Disable sensor (for low power mode)

# Firmware

For compiling and upload the current firmware, please firts install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install) or include the project in your `Arduino IDE`. Also you need the [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) software. Please check that the commands `pio` and `git` works fine in your OS.

## Compiling and Installing

First, please clone this repo:
```python
git clone https://github.com/hpsaturn/CanAirIO.git
```

Connect your device to USB cable , enter to `CanAirIO` directory and run:

```python
pio run --target upload
```

You should have something like this:
```python
Building .pio/build/ttgo-display/firmware.bin
RAM:   [==        ]  19.7% (used 64684 bytes from 327680 bytes)
Flash: [========= ]  86.4% (used 1698140 bytes from 1966080 bytes)
esptool.py v2.6
============== [SUCCESS] Took 33.86 seconds ==================

Environment       Status    Duration
----------------  --------  ------------
ttgo-display      SUCCESS   00:00:33.861
ttgo-display-ota  IGNORED
============= 1 succeeded in 00:00:33.861 =====================
```
## OTA update

**Optional** you could send OTA updates of this firmware with:

```python
pio run -e ttgo-display-ota --target upload
```

It will be try to send the firmware to CanAirIO.local host on your network, it this does not working, you can try to add IP parameter with `--upload-port=your_esp_ip`.

# Android CanAirIO application

For now you need any Android device with Bluetooth 4 or above. You can download the CanAirIO app from [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hpsaturn.pollutionreporter), keep in mind that it is in continuos development then please any feedback, report errors, or any thing please let us knowed it via our [contact form](http://canair.io/#three) or on our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/canairio)

You have **two configuration options or modes** of your CanAirIO device from the app:

## Mobile Station Mode

For record tracks on your device (Sdcard) or publish it to the cloud (share), please follow the next steps:

### Connection to device

<a href="https://github.com/kike-canaries/esp32-hpma115s0/blob/master/images/device_connection.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kike-canaries/esp32-hpma115s0/master/images/device_connection.jpg" width="512" align="center" ></a>

### Recording track and share

<a href="https://github.com/kike-canaries/esp32-hpma115s0/blob/master/images/app_track_record.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kike-canaries/esp32-hpma115s0/master/images/app_track_record.jpg" width="512" align="center" ></a>

**NOTE**: Also all recorded tracks will be saved in the `/sdcard/canairio/` directory on `json` format.

## Static Station Mode

<img width="640" src="screenshots/influxdb_grafana.jpg">

Also, you can connect your CanAirIO device to the WiFi and leave this like a fixed station. In this mode you only need the Android app only for initial settings, after that the device could be publish data without the phone. For this you need configure it in `settings` section:

### Settings

<img align="right" width="400" src="screenshots/canairio_app_settings.png">


- **Station Name**: for example: `PM25_Berlin_Pankow`
- **Wifi Name and Password**:
  - Your Wifi network credentials.
  - Save the credentials with the switch.
- **InfluxDB Cloud**: add the next values,
  - Database name: `canairio`  
  - Hostname: `influxdb.canair.io`
  - Save the settings with the switch.

The data will be configured and showed in [CanAirIO Grafana Server](https://bit.ly/3bLpz0H).

### Settings Tools

- Reboot device: Only for restart your CanAirIO device
- Factory Reset: For set all settings to default on your CanAirIO device
